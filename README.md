Script Purpose and Functionality
The purpose of this script is to export a single selected object from an InDesign file into either PDF or EPS format.

The script operates as follows:
1. It copies the selected object.
2. It creates a new document of the appropriate size and pastes the object into it.
3. Then, it exports the document in the previously chosen format.

Limitations
Please be aware of the following limitations:
1. The script will not work if more than one object is selected.
2. The measurement units for rulers in the document must be in millimeters (mm). It is not permissible for the ruler units to differ (e.g., one in mm and another in pixels).
3. The minimum size of the object (either width or height) must not be less than 30 mm.
